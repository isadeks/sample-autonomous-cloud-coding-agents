/**
 * Pure label-mode parsing for the #299 Mode B decomposition planner (B1).
 *
 * #247 (Mode A) reads a *human-authored* sub-issue graph and runs it. #299
 * (Mode B) lets a single, undecomposed issue be auto-decomposed by an LLM
 * planner into that graph first. The two are selected by which trigger label
 * is on the issue:
 *
 *   - ``bgagent``            — today's behaviour. No sub-issues → single task;
 *                              already has sub-issues → run the graph (Mode A).
 *   - ``bgagent:decompose``  — decompose, then POST a plan and WAIT for
 *                              ``@bgagent approve`` (the spend-safe default).
 *   - ``bgagent:auto``       — decompose and run immediately (no approval gate).
 *
 * The decompose suffixes only mean something on an *undecomposed* issue: you
 * cannot decompose what is already a graph, so a ``:decompose`` / ``:auto``
 * suffix on a parent that already has sub-issues is a no-op and falls back to
 * Mode A (#299: "On a parent that already has sub-issues the suffix is a
 * no-op → falls back to the #247 executor").
 *
 * Kept pure (no I/O, no Linear/AWS types) so the routing decision is
 * unit-testable in isolation; the webhook processor does the I/O (resolve the
 * label filter from the project mapping, check for sub-issues, dispatch).
