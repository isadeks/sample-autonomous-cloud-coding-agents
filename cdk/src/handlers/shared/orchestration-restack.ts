/**
 * A6 re-stack planning (#305) — pure logic.
 *
 * When a predecessor sub-issue's PR branch changes after a dependent already
 * merged it in, the dependent is STALE. This module computes WHICH dependents
 * must be re-stacked and IN WHAT ORDER, given an orchestration snapshot and
 * the sub-issue whose branch changed. No I/O — the handler does the GitHub /
 * DynamoDB / task-creation side effects using this plan.
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - Re-stack only the changed node's TRANSITIVE dependents (everything
 *    downstream that built on it, directly or indirectly).
 *  - A dependent is re-stackable only if it has actually started — it carries
 *    a ``child_task_id`` + ``child_branch_name`` (released). A still-``blocked``
 *    dependent will pick up the new predecessor code when it is first
 *    released (A4), so it needs no re-stack.
 *  - Order dependents in topological order (a dependent is re-stacked only
 *    after the predecessors it merges have been re-stacked), so each re-stack
 *    merges already-current predecessor branches.
 *  - The changed node itself is NOT re-stacked (its own branch is what changed).

/**
 * Plan the re-stack of a changed node's DIRECT (one-hop) started dependents.
 *
 * Used by the reconciler-driven cascade (#247 A6 redesign): when an
 * iteration/restack task on node X completes, we re-stack only the children
 * that depend DIRECTLY on X — each of those, when ITS restack task completes,
 * re-fires the reconciler and cascades to ITS dependents. Doing one hop per
 * completion (rather than ``planRestack``'s whole transitive set at once) is
 * what keeps a chain correct: C must re-stack only AFTER B's branch carries
 * the new code, not racing B's restack task.
 *
 * A direct dependent is re-stackable only if it has STARTED (released/terminal
 * with a branch). Its merge-list is its predecessors' current head branches —
 * the changed node + any sibling predecessors that have a branch — so a
 * diamond fan-in re-merges every arm it depends on.
 *
 * @param children full orchestration child snapshot (excl. meta)
 * @param changedSubIssueId the node whose branch just changed
 * @returns the direct dependents to re-stack now (deterministic by id); empty
 *   if none have started.
