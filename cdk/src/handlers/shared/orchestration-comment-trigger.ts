 * a sub-issue's PR changed mentions ``@bgagent`` in a Linear comment on that
 * sub-issue; the platform runs a ``coding/pr-iteration-v1`` task on the
 * sub-issue's PR (and the reconciler then cascades the re-stack to dependents).
 *
 * This module decides — from a comment body alone — whether the comment is an
 * instruction for the agent and what the instruction text is. Kept pure (no
 * I/O, no Linear/AWS types) so the mention parsing is unit-testable and reused
 * regardless of how the comment arrives. The processor does the I/O (resolve
 * sub-issue → orchestration → PR, spawn the task).
