 * it wasn't given, and can proceed with best judgment / note the gap rather
 * than assume the description is complete. It does NOT pre-fetch bodies, screen
 * content, or upload to S3 — description-embedded `uploads.linear.app` files are
 * pre-hydrated separately by `linear-attachments.ts`, and recent human comments
 * by `linear-feedback.fetchRecentComments`.
