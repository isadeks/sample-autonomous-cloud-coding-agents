 *
 * After the planner (B3) produces a {@link DecompositionPlan} and caps (B2) pass,

 * The comment carries everything #299 asks for: sub-issues, dependency edges,
 * per-child S/M/L, the Σ cost CEILING (no absolute-time estimate — see #299),
 * and the critical-path length (longest dependency chain). Critical-path length
 * is the topological layer count from {@link validateDag}: it is the inherent
 * serial floor of the orchestration (Θ(L) agent runs), the number that actually
