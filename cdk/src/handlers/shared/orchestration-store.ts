/**
 * Resolve a released child by its head branch, via the ChildBranchIndex GSI.
 * Maps a branch name back to the child row (which carries
 * ``orchestration_id`` + ``sub_issue_id``).
 *
 * RETAINED, currently unused. This backed the original A6 GitHub
 * ``pull_request`` restack trigger, which the #247 A6 redesign replaced with
 * a Linear-comment trigger + reconciler-driven cascade (the cascade resolves
 * the changed node by sub_issue_id, not by branch). The helper + its GSI are
 * deliberately kept rather than removed: dropping a GSL is a
 * CFN-update-unfriendly stack change for zero functional gain, and a
 * branch→child lookup is a plausible future need (e.g. a branch-delete
 * cleanup path). If it stays unused long-term, remove the helper and the GSI
 * together in a dedicated migration.
 *
 * Returns the child row, or null if no released child owns that branch. The
 * GSI is sparse — only released children carry ``child_branch_name`` — so a
 * miss is the common, cheap case. ``indexName`` is injected (the CDK construct
 * owns the literal) to keep this module free of a CDK dependency.
