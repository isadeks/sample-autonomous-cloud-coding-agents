/**
 * #247 UX.5 — "failure is a conversation". Renders the threaded ❌ reply the
 * agent posts beneath a human's ``@bgagent`` comment when the requested
 * iteration does not land cleanly. Two distinct shapes, per the user's design:
 *
 *  - BUILD/TEST failure (the agent ran and opened/updated a PR, but the build
 *    or tests are red): a sanitized ONE-LINE reason pointing at the agent's
 *    CloudWatch build log. We deliberately do NOT dump the raw build output —
 *    it's untrusted repo code. The pointer is CloudWatch (by task id), NOT the
 *    PR's GitHub checks: the agent runs the configured build (``mise run
 *    build``) INSIDE the microVM, so that output lives in CloudWatch, and the
 *    target repo may have no GitHub CI at all. (Keith 2026-06-28: "subissues
 *    pass, parent build fails" + "saw nothing in the PR" — the old "see the
 *    PR's checks" copy pointed at the wrong, often-empty surface.)
 *
 *  - AGENT-ITSELF failure (the agent crashed / timed out / hit a cap before a
 *    clean terminal): the classified one-line title + a TRUNCATED excerpt of
 *    the raw error, plus a pointer to the full CloudWatch logs by task id.
 *
 * Both always end by inviting a reply — the failure reply is answerable, so
 * the user replies ``@bgagent <guidance>`` and the comment trigger re-runs the
 * iteration on the same PR (UX.3). Pure + deterministic; no I/O.
