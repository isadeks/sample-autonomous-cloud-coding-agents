/**
 * #299 Mode B — the decomposition FLOW orchestrator (B6 core).
 *
 * Ties the B2/B4/B5 pieces into the caps→propose/seed logic Mode B needs, with
 * all I/O injected so the control flow is unit-testable without Linear / DDB:
 *
 *  1. {@link applyDecompositionResult} — given an already-PRODUCED plan (parsed
 *     from the ``coding/decompose-v1`` agent's plan artifact by the reconciler),
 *     caps (B2) → either post a proposal and persist a pending plan (manual), or
 *     write back + return the graph for immediate seeding (auto).
 *  2. {@link runPlanVerdict} — an ``@bgagent approve``/``reject`` comment on the
 *     parent. Approve → consume the pending plan → write back → return the
 *     graph for seeding. Reject → discard + acknowledge.
 *
 * Both return a discriminated result the caller maps to its existing machinery:
 * a ``seed`` result carries a ``SubIssueNode[]`` handed to ``discoverOrchestration``
 * via ``declarativeGraphSource`` (then releases roots exactly as Mode A does);
 * the other results are terminal (a comment was posted, nothing to seed).
 *
 * #299 agent-native planning: the MODEL-INVOKE head (the old ``runDecompositionProposal``
 * that called Bedrock inline) was RETIRED — planning moved into the agent, which
 * clones the repo and plans with full context. This module keeps only the parts
 * downstream of "a plan exists".
