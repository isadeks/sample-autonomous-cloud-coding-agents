/**
 * #299 Mode B — the decomposition FLOW orchestrator (B6 core).
 *
 * Ties the B1–B5 pieces into the two events Mode B reacts to, with all I/O
 * injected so the control flow is unit-testable without Bedrock / Linear / DDB:
 *
 *  1. {@link runDecompositionProposal} — a ``:decompose`` / ``:auto`` label on
 *     an UNDECOMPOSED issue. Judge+plan (B3) → caps (B2) → either post a
 *     proposal and persist a pending plan (manual), or write back + return the
 *     graph for immediate seeding (auto).
 *  2. {@link runPlanVerdict} — an ``@bgagent approve``/``reject`` comment on the
 *     parent. Approve → consume the pending plan → write back → return the
 *     graph for seeding. Reject → discard + acknowledge.
 *
 * Both return a discriminated result the processor maps to its existing
 * machinery: a ``seed`` result carries a ``SubIssueNode[]`` the processor hands
 * to ``discoverOrchestration`` via ``declarativeGraphSource`` (then releases
 * roots exactly as Mode A does); the other results are terminal (a comment was
 * posted, nothing to seed).
