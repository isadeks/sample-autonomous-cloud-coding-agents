 * #614: start NEW work from a follow-up comment on a PR-less completed task.
 *

 * can finish with no PR (no change needed, failed before committing, or a
 * question/investigation run), and a follow-up ``@bgagent <request>`` on such an
 * issue is almost always a fresh ask ("then just do X instead") — not iteration.
 * Before #614 those comments hit a silent ``return`` and vanished. This dispatches
 * a fresh ``coding/new-task-v1`` against the SAME repo, using the comment text as
 * the task description, with the same 👀-ack + threaded reply + fanout terminal
 * ownership as the iteration/clarify paths.
 *
 * Returns true when it handled the comment (a task was dispatched, OR a bare
 * mention was answered with a "nothing to do" reply), false when it cannot act
 * (no repo/user) so the caller falls through to its no-op log.
 *
 * Best-effort: a dispatch failure is logged and still returns true (we already
 * ACKed) — the fanout terminal path reports the outcome.
