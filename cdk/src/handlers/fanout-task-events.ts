/**
 * Fan-out plane router (design §6 / §8.9).
 *
 * DynamoDB Streams on `TaskEventsTable` deliver NEW_IMAGE records to
 * this Lambda. For each record we resolve a per-channel event filter
 * (``CHANNEL_DEFAULTS`` modulo optional per-task overrides from
 * `TaskRecord.notifications`, §6.5) and hand the event only to the
 * channels whose filter includes it. Channels do NOT share a single
 * union filter — Slack wants interactive signals (errors, approvals,
 * status responses) that would be noise on Email, while GitHub only
 * cares about PR activity + terminal outcomes.
 *
 * This handler is a **skeleton**: per-channel dispatcher stubs log
 * each would-be delivery to CloudWatch but don't call Slack / GitHub /
 * SES yet. The design explicitly allows this:
 *
 *   "the fan-out Lambda itself can ship later without any change to
 *    the agent or CLI"  — §8.9
 *
 * Enabling a real dispatcher is a per-channel PR: add the SDK client
 * (e.g. `@slack/web-api`), replace the `log-only` block, add an IAM
 * policy (or Secrets Manager grant) on the Lambda's execution role,
 * and add the channel's configuration (OAuth token ARN + channel ID,
 * GitHub App credentials, SES verified identity) to the construct's
 * props. Chunk J ships the first real dispatcher (GitHub edit-in-place).

/**
 * Lambda entry point. Invoked by the DynamoDB Streams event source
 * mapping with batches of NEW_IMAGE records from `TaskEventsTable`.
 *
 * Returns a ``DynamoDBBatchResponse`` so the event-source-mapping's
 * ``reportBatchItemFailures: true`` setting (see
 * ``constructs/fanout-consumer.ts``) can honor partial-batch semantics.
 * Without a structured return, a single poisonous record would cause
 * Lambda to retry the **entire batch** from the stream checkpoint,
 * replaying every sibling event and defeating the per-task ordering
 * guarantee promised by ``ParallelizationFactor: 1`` upstream.
 *
 * Partial-failure surface (per-record try/catch below):
 *   - ``routeEvent`` wraps each dispatcher in ``Promise.allSettled``, so
 *     dispatcher rejections are already caught at the channel granularity
 *     and do not reach here. What DOES reach here is a throw BEFORE the
 *     ``allSettled`` — e.g. ``resolveTokenSecretArn`` throwing
 *     ``AccessDeniedException`` on an IAM misconfig (deliberate hard fail
 *     inside ``dispatchToGitHubComment``), a synchronous throw in
 *     ``loadTaskForComment`` on a broken DDB env, or any future writer
 *     that opens a non-``allSettled`` code path.
 *   - Parse / filter / rate-limit errors are defensive — today they
 *     cannot throw, but catching them keeps one stray ``throw`` in a
 *     future refactor (e.g. a stricter ``parseStreamRecord``) from
 *     crashing the whole batch.
 *
 * On any caught throw we push ``{ itemIdentifier: record.eventID }`` so
 * Lambda retries ONLY that record, isolating the poison pill per
 * design §6 + §8.9 expectations. Successful records are NOT in
 * ``batchItemFailures`` and advance the stream checkpoint normally.
 *
 * Refs: PR #52 krokoko code review findings #1 and #5 (the fanout
 * handler returned ``void`` despite ``reportBatchItemFailures: true``,
 * and a ``routeEvent`` throw from ``resolveTokenSecretArn`` could crash
 * the whole batch).
