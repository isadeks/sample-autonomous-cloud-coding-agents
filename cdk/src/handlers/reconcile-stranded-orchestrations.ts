/**
 * Scheduled backstop for Linear orchestration (#247 A3, gap #303).
 *
 * The live reconciler (``orchestration-reconciler``) releases
 * dependency-unblocked children by reacting to TaskTable-stream terminal
 * events. If the reconciler is unavailable when a child reaches terminal
 * state (deploy window, throttle, OOM, a poison-record batch parked in
 * the DLQ), **that stream event is lost and never reprocessed** — the
 * dependent children never get released and the orchestration stalls
 * forever with no recovery.
 *
 * Observed live on dev (2026-06-09): a child reached COMPLETED during a
 * reconciler OOM window; after the fix deployed, the completion event was
 * gone, so its dependent stayed ``blocked`` until a manual nudge.
 *
 * This scheduled sweep is the recovery path. It also fixes the
 * crash-after-flip hole that the F2 fix relies on (a child stuck
 * ``released`` whose task is long-terminal, or a ``ready`` child whose
 * release never created a task — see
 * ``docs/research/orchestration-reconciler-correctness.md``).
 *
 * For each active orchestration it re-derives the gating truth from
 * persisted state and:
 *   - releases any ``blocked``/``ready`` child whose predecessors are all
 *     ``succeeded`` (lost release-event recovery), and
 *   - re-evaluates children whose own task already reached terminal but
 *     whose row never advanced (lost terminal-event recovery), advancing
 *     the row + cascading skips/releases accordingly.
 *
 * Idempotent: ``releaseChild`` is idempotency-keyed and the row flips are
 * conditional, so re-running the sweep (or racing the live reconciler) is
 * safe.
