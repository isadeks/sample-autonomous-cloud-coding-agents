   *
   * ## Why the orchestrator carries values it never uses itself
   *
   * On AgentCore these live in the runtime's `environmentVariables` and on ECS in
   * the container's `environment` — CDK sets them directly on the compute. A
   * Lambda MicroVM snapshot cannot have them: ADR-021 sub-decision 3 forbids
   * baking configuration into an image that is shared across tasks and
   * deployments, so the only channel is the `/run` payload the orchestrator
   * writes (`platform_config`, assembled by
   * `handlers/shared/strategies/lambda-microvm-strategy.ts`). That makes the
   * orchestrator's own environment the transport, which is why these appear here
   * rather than on `LambdaMicrovmCompute`.
   *
   * ## Names, ARNs — and NO grants
   *
   * Every field is an identifier, never a secret value, and NONE of them adds an
   * IAM grant to the orchestrator role: it forwards these strings and never calls
   * the resources they name (the agent does, through its own execution role /
   * SessionRole). The approvals and nudges tables in particular stay ungranted to
   * the orchestrator, which is asserted by a unit test — a "while I'm here" grant
   * would hand the orchestration plane tenant-data access it has never needed.
   *
   * ## All-or-nothing, and wired unconditionally
   *
   * Every field is required so a partial configuration is unrepresentable (same
   * rationale as `ecsConfig` / `microvmConfig`). The stack wires it for EVERY
   * compute type rather than under the `lambda-microvm` gate: the strategy fails
   * the session start when a required identifier is missing, and that guard should
   * only ever fire for a hand-edited Lambda environment — never because a
   * deploy-time gate and a per-repo `compute_type` disagreed.
   *
   * Optional as a prop only so isolated construct tests can omit it. Four of the
   * thirteen `platform_config` keys come from env vars the orchestrator already
   * carries for its own work (`TASK_TABLE_NAME`, `TASK_EVENTS_TABLE_NAME`,
