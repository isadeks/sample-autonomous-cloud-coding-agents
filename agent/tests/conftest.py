# LAYER 1 of the structural git isolation (#855). Importing the autouse fixture
# here — rather than declaring it per test file, as the four previous fixes did —
# is what makes it cover test modules that do not exist yet. ``_isolate_git_env``
# and ``_git_isolation_home`` are referenced only by pytest's fixture collector,
# hence the noqa: they are not "unused imports".

# Session-wide hang backstop. SIGALRM (pytest-timeout method="signal") fires only
# in the MAIN thread during a test's *call* phase, so a deadlock in a WORKER
# thread, a fixture, collection, or a C-level socket read the main thread never
# returns from stalls the whole `mise run build` silently — up to the platform's
# 3600s build-verify ceiling (the ECS-only stall we chased for weeks, and the
# scoped-session S3 hang the _clean_env reset below guards against: 40+ min of
# dead air, container never reaped).
#
# The obvious instrument — ``faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(1200, exit=True)``
# — does NOT work here: faulthandler has a SINGLE internal timer, and pytest's
# ``faulthandler_timeout`` (pyproject.toml) RE-ARMS it at the start of every test
# WITHOUT ``exit=True``. So a session-level exit timer is cancelled by the first
# test, the per-test timer only DUMPS, and the suite hangs forever anyway.
#
# So own the reaper on a dedicated daemon thread pytest cannot touch. A blocked
# socket read releases the GIL, so this thread runs; it dumps every thread's
# stack for diagnosis and then HARD-EXITS the process, so `mise run build`
# returns non-zero within seconds of the deadline instead of burning to the
# ceiling. Deadline 600s: a SESSION backstop for the whole-suite hangs SIGALRM
# can't interrupt — sized well above the longest healthy run (the suite normally
# finishes in seconds; the per-test pytest-timeout cap is 120s, see
# pyproject.toml) yet far under the 3600s build-verify ceiling.
#
# ``pytest_sessionfinish`` cancels the timer on a clean finish (below), so a
# legitimately slow-but-passing run that lands near 600s — e.g. still in teardown
# / coverage write — is NOT hard-exited into a bewildering red.
# ``os._exit`` skips atexit + buffer flush, so it must only fire on a TRUE hang.

    hang), so this only prevents the false-positive kill.

    stripping it in ``_AGENT_ENV_VARS`` above — the ECS task def sets it, so on

    the var gone AND the cache reset, every test resolves the unscoped path where
    its ``boto3.client`` mock intercepts. Otherwise a mocked test (e.g.
