"""Channel-specific MCP configuration for the agent container.

For inbound channel sources that have a hosted MCP we write (or merge into)
``.mcp.json`` in the cloned repo ``cwd`` so the Claude Agent SDK — configured
with ``setting_sources=["project"]`` — picks up the channel MCP at session
start and exposes the server's tools.

Currently wired channels:
- ``jira``    → Atlassian Remote MCP entry — a NON-FUNCTIONAL placeholder. It
  is written for forward-compatibility but cannot connect from a headless
  agent (interactive OAuth 2.1 only); live outbound Jira comments go through
  the REST shim in ``jira_reactions.py``. See ``JIRA_MCP_URL`` below + ADR-015.

Linear is NOT written here: ABCA runs Linear 100% deterministically (ADR-016
"Linear is fully deterministic"). There is no Linear MCP — issue text, recent
comments, and attachments are pre-hydrated at the Lambda tier (the webhook
processor + ``linear-attachments.ts`` / ``linear-feedback.fetchRecentComments``),
and outbound reactions / state transitions go through direct GraphQL in
``linear_reactions.py`` (which reads ``LINEAR_API_TOKEN`` set by config.py —
independent of this module). The Linear MCP was removed after it proved
non-functional against a single OAuth app (actor=user data reads error;
actor=app can't re-consent an installed app).

Beyond WRITING channel entries, this module also ENFORCES the Linear-no-MCP
guarantee: {@link strip_linear_mcp_servers} removes any Linear MCP server a repo
may have COMMITTED to its own ``.mcp.json`` before the SDK loads it (the prompt
prohibition is not a security boundary — the SDK loads ``project`` settings and
we export ``LINEAR_API_TOKEN``). The pipeline calls it after
``configure_channel_mcp`` on every task with a repo.

For all other channel sources ``configure_channel_mcp`` is a no-op: no MCP is
written (though the scrub above still runs).

See: cdk/src/handlers/{linear,jira}-webhook-processor.ts (inbound),
runner.py (SDK invocation), ADR-016 (Linear determinism).

#: Atlassian Remote MCP endpoint — Streamable HTTP transport.
#:
#: IMPORTANT: this entry does NOT work from a headless agent and is retained
#: only as a forward-looking placeholder. The hosted Atlassian MCP requires an
#: interactive, browser-based OAuth 2.1 flow with dynamic client registration
#: and will NOT accept the stored REST OAuth token as a Bearer header, so it
#: fails to connect in the runtime (``claude mcp list`` → "Failed to connect").
#:
#: The LIVE outbound path is the REST shim in ``agent/src/jira_reactions.py``
#: (the "Plan B" that became Plan A), which posts comments via the Jira REST
#: v3 API using the same stored OAuth token. See ADR-015 and
#: ``agent/src/prompt_builder.py``. If Atlassian ever ships a token-compatible
#: MCP, this entry can be promoted and the REST shim retired.
