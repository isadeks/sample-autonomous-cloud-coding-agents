"""Channel-specific MCP configuration for the agent container.

For inbound channel sources that have a hosted MCP we write (or merge into)
``.mcp.json`` in the cloned repo ``cwd`` so the Claude Agent SDK — configured
with ``setting_sources=["project"]`` — picks up the channel MCP at session
start and exposes the server's tools.

Currently wired channels:
- ``linear``  → Linear hosted MCP (``mcp__linear-server__*`` tools) — functional.
- ``jira``    → Atlassian Remote MCP entry — a NON-FUNCTIONAL placeholder. It
  is written for forward-compatibility but cannot connect from a headless
  agent (interactive OAuth 2.1 only); live outbound Jira comments go through
  the REST shim in ``jira_reactions.py``. See ``JIRA_MCP_URL`` below + ADR-015.

For all other channel sources this is a no-op: no MCP is written, and the
SDK sees no channel-specific tools.

See: cdk/src/handlers/{linear,jira}-webhook-processor.ts (inbound),
runner.py (SDK invocation).
