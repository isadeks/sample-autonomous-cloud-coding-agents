"""OpenTelemetry instrumentation helpers for the background agent.

Provides a tracer and a convenience context manager for creating spans
with standard task attributes.  ADOT auto-instrumentation (activated via
the ``opentelemetry-instrument`` wrapper in the Dockerfile) handles
exporter/propagator configuration automatically for AgentCore-hosted
agents — this module only needs to create spans and set baggage.
