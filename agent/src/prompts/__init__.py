"""Prompt module — selects the system prompt template by resolved workflow id.

Today the runner uses these built-in prompt modules. A planned later stage will
instead resolve a workflow file's ``prompt.template: registry://...`` through a
prompt registry (see WORKFLOWS.md). The lookup is keyed by workflow id;
``DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_ID`` is the fallback for an unknown/absent id.
