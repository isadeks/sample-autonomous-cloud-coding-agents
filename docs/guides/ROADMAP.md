- [x] **Mid-run steering (nudge)** - `bgagent nudge` sends guidance to a running agent; combined-turn acknowledgement (agent emits `nudge_acknowledged` before incorporating)
- [x] **Execution tracing** - `--trace` on submit raises preview cap to 4 KB and uploads full gzipped NDJSON trajectory to S3; `bgagent trace download` retrieves it
- [x] **Deterministic status snapshot** - `bgagent status` derives all fields from task record + recent events with no LLM in the loop
- [x] **Debug output** - `--verbose` flag emits full HTTP request/response on stderr for any CLI command

### Notification plane

- [x] **DDB Stream fanout** - FanOut Consumer Lambda on TaskEventsTable streams (ParallelizationFactor: 1 for per-task ordering) routes events to channel dispatchers
- [x] **GitHub edit-in-place** - Single status comment per task on the target PR, edited in place as progress events fire (phase, milestone, cost, link)
- [x] **Routable agent milestones** - Named checkpoints (`pr_created`, `nudge_acknowledged`) unwrapped against allowlist for channel filter matching
- [ ] **Slack dispatcher** - Log-only stub; pending full Slack Block Kit integration

- [x] **Runtime error classifier** - Pattern-matching classifier that categorizes task errors (auth/network/concurrency/compute/agent/guardrail/config/timeout/unknown) with human-readable titles, descriptions, remedies, and retryability flags. Computed at API response time; powers structured CLI error display and CloudWatch alarm routing
- [x] **Enhanced error classifiers** - Specific terminal-state classifiers (`error_max_turns`, `error_max_budget_usd`, `error_during_execution`) for precise CLI display and alarm routing

### Agent harness

## What's next

Planned capabilities, grouped by theme. Items are independent and may ship in any order.

### Credentials and authorization

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Per-session IAM scoping** | Generate short-lived, scoped credentials per task via `sts:AssumeRole` with session tags (`user_id`, `repo`, `task_id`). DynamoDB leading-key conditions restrict each session to its own partition. Bedrock model access scoped to an explicit ARN allowlist instead of `*`. Eliminates cross-tenant blast radius from a compromised agent session. |
| **Per-repo GitHub credentials** | GitHub App per org/repo via AgentCore Token Vault. Auto-refresh for long sessions. Sets the pattern for GitLab, Jira, Slack integrations. |
| **Principal-to-repo authorization** | Map Cognito identities to allowed repository sets. Users can only trigger work on authorized repos. |

### Agent quality

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Autonomous feedback loop** | Extend the orchestrator state machine beyond `PR_OPENED` with a PR watcher phase. Auto-resume the agent when CI fails (inject failure logs), merge conflicts arise (rebase instructions), or reviewers request changes (inline comments). Continue the loop until the PR is merged or a human cancels. Optionally auto-merge when CI passes and review is approved. Transforms ABCA from "open PR" to "merge PR". |
| **Tiered validation pipeline** | Three post-agent tiers: tool validation (build/test/lint), code quality (DRY/SOLID/complexity), risk and blast radius analysis. |
| **In-pipeline build/lint fix-up loop** | Today the agent path is linear (clone → code → build → lint → PR); a post-change **verify_build** / **verify_lint** failure fails the task. Instead, loop back into the agent with the failure output as extra context, up to a **configurable retry count**, then fail only if fixes are exhausted—while still respecting the existing **max_turns** budget. Likely implementable in **`pipeline.py`** (after `run_agent()`, on verification failure re-invoke the agent) **without orchestrator changes**; distinct from the **Autonomous feedback loop** (PR/CI after the PR exists). |
| **In-pipeline pre-PR self-review** | Post-hooks already run **build** / **lint**, but the LLM is not prompted to **self-review** its own diff before the PR. Add an optional in-pipeline step: surface the change set (diff), have the model **critique** it (bugs, style, edge cases, test gaps), then **iterate** on fixes—within the same **max_turns** / budget constraints. Aims to improve first-pass PR quality before human or CI review; implementable alongside other **`pipeline.py`** phases. |
| **PR risk classification** | Rule-based risk classifier at submission. Drives model selection, budget defaults, approval requirements. |
| **PR scope creep check (`pr_review`)** | Add an advisory-first scope analysis in `pr_review` that compares declared intent (task description / issue / PR narrative) to the actual diff and touched areas. Return structured output with `scope_rating` (`within_scope`/`mild_expansion`/`significant_expansion`/`likely_scope_creep`), confidence, and rationale (files, API/schema/config changes, unrelated dependency churn). Start as non-blocking reviewer guidance; optional policy gates can be enabled later for high-risk repos. |
| **Review feedback memory loop** | Capture PR review comments via webhook, extract rules via LLM, persist as searchable memory. |
| **PR outcome tracking** | Track merge/reject via GitHub webhooks. Positive/negative signals feed evaluation and memory. |
| **Evaluation pipeline** | Failure categorization, memory effectiveness metrics (merge rate, revision cycles, CI pass rate). |
| **A/B prompt experiments** | Assign prompt variants per task or cohort; compare merge rate, failure rate, and token usage with statistical guardrails. |
| **LLM-assisted trace analysis** | Automated deep dive on failed trajectories (logs + spans) to surface recurring reasoning and tool-use failure modes. |
| **Validation and risk analytics** | Dashboards for PR risk labels, validation outcomes, and trends by repo, user, and `prompt_version`; eventually feed learned memory rules into Tier 2 when the tiered pipeline ships. |

### Memory security

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Trust-aware retrieval** | Weight memories by freshness, source type, pattern consistency. |
| **Temporal decay** | Configurable per-entry TTL with faster decay for unverified content. |
| **Anomaly detection** | CloudWatch metrics on write patterns; alarms for burst writes or suspicious content. |
| **Quarantine and rollback** | Operator API for isolating suspicious entries and restoring pre-task snapshots. |
| **Write-ahead validation** | Route proposed memory writes through a guardian model. |
| **Review feedback quorum** | Promote review-derived rules to persistent memory only after corroboration (e.g. pattern seen across trusted reviewers and PRs), reducing single-comment poisoning. Complements **Review feedback memory loop**. |
| **Memory backup to S3** | Scheduled export of AgentCore Memory namespaces to versioned S3 for disaster recovery and pre-poisoning restore (see design: `SECURITY.md`). |
| **Memory extraction replay** | Operator API (e.g. `start_memory_extraction_job`) to re-run failed PR-review extraction after webhook or Lambda errors. |
| **Structured knowledge graph (tier 4)** | Optional long-term direction if semantic + episodic memory proves insufficient for repo-specific query patterns. |

### Security (execution guardrails)

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Behavioral circuit breaker** | Per-session limits on tool-call rate, cumulative cost, consecutive failures, and file churn; pause or terminate when thresholds are exceeded. Configurable per repo via Blueprint (design: `SECURITY.md`, `REPO_ONBOARDING.md`). |
| **Tool capability tiers** | Opt-in **extended** tool profile per repo: MCP servers, plugins, and additional Gateway-mediated tools beyond the default minimal surface (`COMPUTE.md`). Enforced at Gateway and policy layers. |

### Channels and integrations

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Task attachments (multimodal)** | Implement end-to-end support for the create-task **`attachments`** array (`API_CONTRACT.md`: `image`, `file`, `url` — inline base64 or fetchable URL, size/MIME limits). Flow through validation, guardrails, context hydration, and agent prompt so images (screenshots, mockups), documents, and linked assets reach the model where the channel allows it. Extend **CLI** and **webhook** task creation to populate the same schema. *Multimodal* is the vision/image path; attachments are the unified carrier for all non-text task context. |
| **Additional git providers** | GitLab (and optionally Bitbucket). Same workflow, provider-specific API adapters. |
| **Slack integration** | Submit tasks, check status, receive notifications from Slack. Block Kit rendering. |
| **Control panel** | Web UI: task list, task detail with logs/traces, cancel, metrics dashboards, cost attribution. |
| **Slack notification dispatcher** | Full Slack Block Kit rendering for the existing DDB-Stream fanout pipeline. Stub exists today (logs only). |
| **Email notification dispatcher** | SES-based email notifications via the existing fanout pipeline. Stub exists today (logs only). |
| **Per-user notification preferences** | DynamoDB (or equivalent) store for preferred channels, per-channel config, and event filters (`INPUT_GATEWAY.md`). |
| **Browser extension channel** | Lightweight extension to open tasks from GitHub issue/PR pages using existing webhook or OAuth-issued JWT; same internal message contract as other channels. |

### Compute and performance

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Adaptive model router** | Per-turn model selection by complexity. Cheaper models for reads, Opus for complex reasoning. ~30-40% cost reduction. |
| **Alternative compute** | ECS/Fargate or EKS via ComputeStrategy interface. For workloads exceeding AgentCore's 2 GB image limit or requiring GPU. |
| **Environment pre-warming** | Pre-build container layers per repo. Snapshot-on-schedule (rebuild on push). Cold start from minutes to seconds. |

### Onboarding and repo lifecycle

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Automated re-onboarding** | Event-driven refresh of blueprint-related artifacts when the default branch changes materially (GitHub webhook); optional EventBridge schedule for periodic drift checks. Distinct from **Scheduled triggers** (task creation). |
| **Dynamic onboarding artifacts** | When repo hygiene is weak, generate attachments for the agent context: codebase summaries, dependency graphs, suggested rules from layout (`REPO_ONBOARDING.md`). |

### Cost governance

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Org and team budgets** | Per-user and per-team monthly token or USD budgets with alerting (e.g. 80%) and optional hard stop at 100%. |
| **Complexity-aware model router** | Route each request to the most appropriate model based on task complexity (simple reads/edits to cheaper models, deeper reasoning to stronger models) while honoring budget and policy constraints. |

### Observability and safe deploy

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Admission backlog observability** | Metric and alarm when `SUBMITTED` task depth exceeds an operator threshold (capacity and admission health). |
| **Admission queue with deferred pickup** | When admission is at capacity, persist tasks in a durable queue instead of failing them. Automatically re-attempt admission and continue processing in FIFO order (with optional priority lanes) as concurrency becomes available. Preserve cancel/idempotency semantics and expose queue position/ETA in task status. |
| **Safe orchestrator deploys** | Pre-deploy checks for active tasks (drain or warn); blue-green or canary Lambda deploy for the durable orchestrator with rollback on error regressions (`OBSERVABILITY.md`). |

### Scale and collaboration

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Multi-user and teams** | Team visibility, shared approval queues, team concurrency/cost budgets, memory isolation. |
| **Agent swarm** | Planner-worker architecture for complex multi-file tasks. DAG of subtasks, merge orchestrator, one consolidated PR. |
| **Cedar-driven HITL approval gates** | Three-outcome model (allow/hard-deny/soft-deny) for tool-call governance with Cedar policy engine. |
| **Multi-user nudge** | Extend `bgagent nudge` to support multiple users injecting context into the same running task. Per-nudge commit attribution. (Single-user nudge shipped.) |
| **Scheduled triggers** | Cron-based task creation via EventBridge (dependency updates, nightly flaky test checks). |

### Platform maturity

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Unified liveness decision model (follow-up design ticket)** | Normalize task health evaluation across compute backends so heartbeat, compute session status, and DynamoDB state are handled through a single typed decision path. Define explicit backend capabilities (for example, heartbeat support), deterministic precedence rules for terminal outcomes, and regression tests that prevent cross-runtime false failures like ECS heartbeat mismatch. |
| **Pure decision function orchestrator refactor** | Extract orchestrator decision logic into pure functions that take a frozen snapshot and return a typed action. Side-effectful execution applies actions with CAS (compare-and-swap) guards on DynamoDB `updated_at` to prevent stale writes. Makes the orchestrator exhaustively unit-testable without mocking I/O, eliminates competing-worker race conditions, and is a prerequisite for the autonomous feedback loop. |
| **Blueprint custom steps and step sequences** | Lambda-backed `pre-agent` / `post-agent` steps and optional `step_sequence` overrides with CDK synth + runtime validation and `INVALID_STEP_SEQUENCE` on misconfiguration (`REPO_ONBOARDING.md`, `ORCHESTRATOR.md`). |
| **Blueprint RepoConfig parity** | Extend the Blueprint construct to persist per-repo default `max_budget_usd` and `memory_token_budget` in DynamoDB (orchestrator already merges `max_budget_usd` when present; hydration uses a fixed memory token cap today). |
| **Orchestrator DLQ** | Dead-letter path for task orchestration after retry exhaustion so operators can inspect and replay failed durable executions (`ORCHESTRATOR.md`). |
| **Stuck-task reconciliation (operator notify/resume)** | The scheduled stranded-task reconciler shipped (detects and fails stuck tasks). Further: operator notification before forced failure, manual resume option (`ORCHESTRATOR.md`). |
| **EventBridge / SNS integration** | Publish task lifecycle events to EventBridge or SNS for external consumers beyond the built-in DDB-Stream fanout (which already powers GitHub edit-in-place, Slack, and email dispatchers). |
| **CDK constructs library** | Publish reusable constructs to Construct Hub with semver versioning. |
| **Centralized policy framework** | Unified Cedar-based framework with `PolicyDecisionEvent` audit schema. Three enforcement modes with observe-before-enforce rollout. |
| **Formal verification** | TLA+ specification of task state machine, concurrency, cancellation races, reconciler interleavings. |
