# Quick start

Go from zero to your first agent-created pull request in about 30 minutes. This guide covers only the minimum path - see the [Developer guide](./DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and [User guide](./USER_GUIDE.md) for the full details.

## Prerequisites

Install these before you begin:

- **AWS account** with credentials configured (`aws configure`). If you use named profiles, set `AWS_PROFILE` before running any commands in this guide.
- **Docker** - for building the agent container image
- **mise** - task runner ([install guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html))
- **AWS CDK CLI** - `npm install -g aws-cdk` (after mise is active)

## Step 1 - Clone and install

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage tool versions (Node.js, Python, security scanners) and run tasks across the monorepo. Yarn Classic handles JavaScript workspaces (`cdk/`, `cli/`, `docs/`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents.git
cd sample-autonomous-cloud-coding-agents

# Trust mise config and install tools
mise trust
mise install

# Enable Yarn via Corepack
corepack enable
corepack prepare yarn@1.22.22 --activate

# Install dependencies and build
export MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1
mise run install
mise run build
```

`mise run install` installs all JavaScript and Python dependencies across the monorepo. `mise run build` compiles the CDK app, the CLI, the agent image, and the docs site. A successful build means you are ready to deploy.

> **Note:** `mise run build` includes CDK synthesis, which queries AWS for availability zones. Your active AWS credentials must have at least `ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones` permission, or the build will fail. If you use named profiles, make sure `AWS_PROFILE` is set before running the build.

## Step 2 - Prepare a repository

The agent works by cloning a GitHub repository, creating a branch, making code changes, running the build and tests, and opening a pull request. This means it needs **write access** to a real repository.

The easiest way to start is to **fork** [`awslabs/agent-plugins`](https://github.com/awslabs/agent-plugins) - a lightweight sample repo designed for testing the platform.

### Create a GitHub personal access token

The agent authenticates to GitHub using a **fine-grained personal access token (PAT)**. Go to GitHub > **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Fine-grained tokens**. Scope it to **only your fork** with these permissions:

| Permission | Access | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Contents** | Read and write | Clone the repo and push branches |
| **Pull requests** | Read and write | Create and update pull requests |
| **Issues** | Read | Read issue context for tasks that reference an issue |
| **Metadata** | Read (default) | Required by GitHub for all fine-grained tokens |

Keep the token value - you will store it in AWS Secrets Manager after deploying.

### Register the repo in CDK

Every repository the agent can work on must be **onboarded** as a `Blueprint` construct in the CDK stack. The Blueprint writes a configuration record to DynamoDB; the orchestrator checks this before accepting tasks.

Open `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts`, find the `Blueprint` block, and set `repo` to your fork:

```typescript
new Blueprint(this, 'AgentPluginsBlueprint', {
  repo: 'your-username/agent-plugins',  // your fork
  repoTable: repoTable.table,
  // ... other props stay the same
});
```

The `repo` value must match **exactly** what you will pass to the CLI later (`owner/repo` format).

## Step 3 - Deploy

The CDK stack deploys the full platform: API Gateway, Lambda functions (orchestrator, task CRUD, webhooks), DynamoDB tables, AgentCore Runtime, VPC with network isolation, Cognito user pool, and CloudWatch dashboards.

```bash
# One-time account setup: allow X-Ray to write spans to CloudWatch Logs.
# On a fresh account, X-Ray needs a resource policy before the destination can be set.
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
aws logs put-resource-policy \
  --policy-name xray-spans-policy \
  --policy-document "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"XRaySpansAccess\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"xray.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":[\"logs:PutLogEvents\",\"logs:CreateLogGroup\",\"logs:CreateLogStream\"],\"Resource\":[\"arn:aws:logs:*:${ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:aws/spans\",\"arn:aws:logs:*:${ACCOUNT_ID}:log-group:aws/spans:*\"]}]}"
aws xray update-trace-segment-destination --destination CloudWatchLogs

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
mise run //cdk:bootstrap

# Deploy the stack (~10 minutes)
mise run //cdk:deploy
```

The X-Ray commands are a one-time per-account setup. On a fresh account the `put-resource-policy` call is required first — without it, the `update-trace-segment-destination` command fails with an `AccessDeniedException` because X-Ray cannot write to the `aws/spans` log group. CDK bootstrap provisions the staging resources CDK needs (S3 bucket, IAM roles). The deploy itself takes around 10 minutes - most of the time is spent building the Docker image and provisioning the AgentCore Runtime.

## Step 4 - Store the GitHub token

The agent reads the GitHub PAT from **AWS Secrets Manager** at runtime. The CDK stack created an empty secret for you - now you need to put your token value in it.

```bash
REGION=us-east-1  # your deployment region

SECRET_ARN=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`GitHubTokenSecretArn`].OutputValue | [0]' \
  --output text)

aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --secret-id "$SECRET_ARN" \
  --secret-string "ghp_your_token_here"
```

Replace `ghp_your_token_here` with the actual token from Step 2. Make sure `REGION` matches where you deployed - if it is empty, the AWS CLI builds a malformed endpoint URL and fails silently.

## Step 5 - Create a Cognito user

The REST API uses Amazon Cognito for authentication. Self-signup is disabled, so you create a user via the AWS CLI. The password must be at least 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.

```bash
USER_POOL_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`UserPoolId`].OutputValue' --output text)

aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID \
  --username you@example.com \
  --temporary-password 'TempPass123!@'

aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID \
  --username you@example.com \
  --password 'YourPerm@nent1Pass!' \
  --permanent
```

The first command creates the user with a temporary password. The second sets a permanent password so you do not have to go through a password change flow on first login.

## Step 6 - Configure the CLI and submit a task

The `bgagent` CLI is the recommended way to interact with the platform. It handles Cognito authentication, token caching, and output formatting. You configure it once with the stack outputs, log in, and then submit tasks.

```bash
# Get stack outputs
API_URL=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`ApiUrl`].OutputValue' --output text)
APP_CLIENT_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name backgroundagent-dev \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`AppClientId`].OutputValue' --output text)

# Build and configure the CLI
cd cli
mise run build
node lib/bin/bgagent.js configure \
  --api-url $API_URL \
  --region "$REGION" \
  --user-pool-id $USER_POOL_ID \
  --client-id $APP_CLIENT_ID

# Log in
node lib/bin/bgagent.js login --username you@example.com

# Submit your first task and wait for it to complete
node lib/bin/bgagent.js submit \
  --repo your-username/agent-plugins \
  --task "Add a CODEOWNERS file to the repository root" \
  --wait
```

The `--wait` flag polls until the task reaches a terminal state. A typical simple task takes 2-5 minutes. When it completes, you will see a PR URL in your terminal - open it in your browser to review the agent's work.

Alternatively, use `watch` to stream progress events in real time:

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js watch <TASK_ID>
```

While a task is running, you can steer the agent with a nudge:

```bash
node lib/bin/bgagent.js nudge <TASK_ID> "Also add a test for the edge case"
```

## What happened behind the scenes

Here is what the platform did after you ran `bgagent submit`:

1. **Task creation** - The CLI authenticated via Cognito and sent a `POST /v1/tasks` request. The API validated the request, checked idempotency, and stored a task record in DynamoDB with status `SUBMITTED`.
2. **Orchestration** - The durable orchestrator picked up the task and ran admission control (concurrency limits). It then ran **pre-flight checks** - calling the GitHub API to verify your token can access the repository with push permissions. If the token were read-only, the task would have failed here with a clear error instead of failing later inside the agent.
3. **Context hydration** - The orchestrator assembled the agent's prompt: your task description, any repository memory from past tasks, and the system prompt that defines the agent's behavioral contract. The task transitioned to `HYDRATING`.
4. **Agent execution** - An isolated MicroVM started via AgentCore Runtime. The agent cloned your repository, created a branch (`bgagent/<task-id>/<description-slug>`), made the requested changes, ran `mise run build` to verify the build passes, committed incrementally, and opened a pull request. The task transitioned to `RUNNING`.
5. **Finalization** - The orchestrator detected the agent finished, recorded the PR URL, cost, and duration on the task record, and transitioned to `COMPLETED`.

## Common errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `yarn: command not found` | Corepack not enabled or mise not activated in your shell | Run `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"`, then `corepack enable && corepack prepare yarn@1.22.22 --activate` |
| `MISE_EXPERIMENTAL required` | Namespaced tasks need the experimental flag | `export MISE_EXPERIMENTAL=1` |
| `AccessDeniedException` on `update-trace-segment-destination` | Fresh account missing CloudWatch Logs resource policy for X-Ray | Run `aws logs put-resource-policy` first (see Step 3) |
| CDK deploy fails with "X-Ray Delivery Destination..." | Missing one-time account setup | Run both X-Ray commands in Step 3 |
| `mise run build` fails with `ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones` error | AWS credentials missing or insufficient for CDK synth | Set `AWS_PROFILE` or configure credentials with at least EC2 read access |
| CDK deploy prompts for approval and hangs | Non-interactive terminal (CI/CD, scripts) | Pass `--require-approval never` to `cdk deploy` or use an interactive terminal |
| `put-secret-value` returns double-dot endpoint | `REGION` variable is empty | Set `REGION=us-east-1` (or your actual region) before running the command |
| `REPO_NOT_ONBOARDED` on task submit | Blueprint `repo` does not match what you passed to the CLI | Check `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` - the `repo` value must be exactly `owner/repo` matching your fork |
| `INSUFFICIENT_GITHUB_REPO_PERMISSIONS` | PAT is missing required permissions or is scoped to the wrong repo | Regenerate the PAT with Contents (read/write) and Pull requests (read/write) scoped to your fork, then update Secrets Manager |
| Task stuck in `SUBMITTED` | Orchestrator Lambda may not have been invoked | Check CloudWatch logs for the orchestrator Lambda; verify the stack deployed successfully |
| `node: command not found` in `cli/` | mise shell activation missing | Run `eval "$(mise activate zsh)"` and confirm `node --version` shows v22.x |

## Customizing the platform

Once you have the basic flow working, here are the main ways to customize the platform for your needs.

### Onboard your own repositories

Add more `Blueprint` constructs in `cdk/src/stacks/agent.ts` and redeploy. Each Blueprint registers one repository. You can onboard as many repos as you want - each one gets its own configuration record in DynamoDB.

```typescript
new Blueprint(this, 'MyServiceBlueprint', {
  repo: 'my-org/my-service',
  repoTable: repoTable.table,
});
```

### Per-repo configuration

Blueprints accept optional overrides to customize agent behavior per repository: which model to use, how many turns the agent gets, cost budget limits, extra system prompt instructions, and network egress rules. See the [User guide - Per-repo overrides](./USER_GUIDE.md) for the full list.

```typescript
new Blueprint(this, 'CustomBlueprint', {
  repo: 'my-org/my-service',
  repoTable: repoTable.table,
  agent: {
    modelId: 'anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6',
    maxTurns: 50,
    systemPromptOverrides: 'Always write tests. Use conventional commits.',
  },
});
```

### Add a CLAUDE.md to your repository

The agent automatically loads project-level instructions from `CLAUDE.md` at the repository root (or `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). This is the most effective way to improve agent output for a specific repo - tell it your build commands, coding conventions, architecture boundaries, and constraints. See the [Prompt guide](./PROMPT_GUIDE.md) for examples and best practices.

### Set up webhook integrations

Webhooks let external systems (GitHub Actions, CI pipelines) create tasks without Cognito credentials, using HMAC-SHA256 authentication. This is useful for automating PR review on every PR, or triggering code changes from CI events. See the [User guide - Webhooks](./USER_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions.
